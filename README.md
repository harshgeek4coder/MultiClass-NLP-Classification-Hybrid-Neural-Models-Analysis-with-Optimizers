# Detailed Comparison of Hybrid Deep Neural Models and Optimizers for Multiclass classification inÂ NLP

<p>Multi-class classification based on textual data refers to a supervised machine learning task, where we try to predict a certain class for input data, given the input data in raw textual format. Well, thanks to TensorFlow, we have a variety of algorithms available to perform multi-class classification via natural language processing.</p>

<p>Here , I have tried to perform a detailed analysis and comparison of various hybrid combination of deep neural networks and choosing different optimizer's impact on their learning and training of model and hence , their performance and time taken to train.</p>
